# General Notes

Here's the basic gear you'll need to get started and some notes.

General notes:

- Know your bevel angles and relay them to the store.
- Specify you want it sharp "tip to tail;" otherwise, they dull the tips and tails like they do for recreational skiers.
- Get the skis done by a PRO first at the right edge angle, it makes maintaining a lot easier. If you need to, get them done again mid-season.

# Gear List

## Base stuff

- A table or work surface. Any workbench can do. Some tables are too low. A little higher than a standard table makes it easier to work on. I use a Swix portable table I can take to races.
- A good set of vises... That's not one to skimp on. A good one makes a difference. I use primarily the **Toko World Cup** and I have a second set for when we tune in pairs:

- Break retainers (rubber bands)
- Iron for waxing

- Brushes (2x - One harder to clean, One softer to polish)

- Rotary brush for the cordless drill (very optional)
- Plastic scraper - you'll need many.

- Gumi Stone to clean/de-tune edges

## Side edges

These wear down fast and should be touched after every training session. You will not need the file but should run the diamond stone on them. 

I keep a 3 degree angle on both GS and SL.

You'll need:

- File(s) - for more serious work or tune-ups. It can be very coarse if the edges are round or finer for tune-ups. Files have a direction and can only cut one way.

- Diamond stones - again, paying a little more makes a difference here... You'll need 100 for first passes and 200 to polish a bit on training days. For race day, I would recommend a better polish/honing with a 400 and 600 or 800. With each stone, run it until you don't feel the stone doing much.

- Side edge holder / file guide (**3 degrees, also shown as 97 degrees**)

    Typical (and simple) file/stone holder. For 3 deg, it will be marked 3 or 87.
    
- Clamp - to hold the file on the guide

    This is how you hold the file or stone against the edge.
    
- Sidewall Planner - You need to peel back sidewall to expose enough of the edge. Won't be needed for minor tunes, after a training day, but could be required 2-3 times during the season:

## Base edges

I almost never touch them. I leave that to machines at the store. For SL I have a 0.75 or 0.5 angle. For GS I leave a 1 degree angle.

- Base edge file guide (you'll use the same files and stones you use for the sides)

## Base repairs

Base repair and pTex - once you get enough experience, you can play with repairing the bases yourself. For now, I recommend getting it done. If you want to play on old skis, you'll need:

- ptex candles
- metal scraper
- lighter
- razor blades, sandpaper (fine), and the likes to take down the excess.
